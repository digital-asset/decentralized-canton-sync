.. warning::

    **If you lose your keys, you lose access to your coins**. While regular backups are not necessary to run your node,
    they are **strongly** recommended for recovery purposes.  It is recommended to keep both identity and regular database backups.
    Identity backups allow you to recover your coin but if you have other applications installed,
    they will not allow you to recover data from those apps. (More information in :ref:`Backups section for Validators <validator-backups>`
    or :ref:`Backups section for SVs <sv_backups>`)
